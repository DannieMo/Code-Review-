          Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico
          on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on hunger.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4 class="text-center">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li>
          1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
          thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth
          Administration"
        </li>
        <li>
          1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
          Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how
          food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>
          1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li>
          1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
          budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school
          study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
          plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack,
          but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on
          waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
          applied science.
        </li>
        <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        <li>
          1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
          pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
          program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
          strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for
          each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling
          wheat yields
        </li>
        <li>
          1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
          high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
          fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to
          the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due
          to a rapidly expanding population
        </li>
      </ul>
